    <Name>That's Gross Squish Toy</Name>
    <Description>Aside from just being cool toys, the collection is good for a few very specific purposes. For a kid's Halloween party, I can dream up no better line of party favors. Most of the toys are only fun for the first three minutes, but for children who enjoy being grossed out or grossing somebody else out, that's one heck of a three minutes. Assuming you're willing to offend a few young girls on Halloween night, the "That's Gross" toys would also make for some terrific, memorable giveaways for any incoming trick-or-treaters. They won't remember all of the eighty people who gave them Butterfinger bars, but no child will forget the house that brought them a "Lite Up Eyeball." Those are just two of a dozen purposes the toys could serve. Can you figure out the other ten?
